# YAWYE
A simple web app designed for controlling daily calories intake.

The project is mainly created using ASP.NET Core MVVM, Bootsrap, Entity Framework Core and jQuery.

Will implement full API afterwards, currently only GET possible.

It is still being developed - it is my training area at the moment.
